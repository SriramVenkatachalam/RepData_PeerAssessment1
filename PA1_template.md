First step is loading the data-

```{r}
activities<-read.csv("C:/Users/Sriram V/Documents/R resource folder/activity.csv",header = TRUE)
```
Transformation using as.date function-

```{r}
activities$date<-as.Date(activities$date,format = " %Y-%m-%d")
```
Mean number of steps taken each day
```{r}
activities_day_wise<-aggregate(activities$steps ~ activities$date,FUN = sum)
colnames(activities_day_wise)<-c("date","steps_taken")
#What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
hist(activities_day_wise$steps_taken,col = "blue",main = "Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day")###
avg_steps_taken_per_day<-mean(activities_day_wise$steps_taken)###
median_steps_taken_per_day<-median(activities_day_wise$steps_taken)###
```
The average daily pattern-

```{r}
interval_count<-data.frame(count = rep(1:288,length(unique(activities$date))))
activities_amended<-cbind(activities,interval_count)
activities_amended<-activities_amended[complete.cases(activities_amended$steps),]
avg_steps_intervalwise<-tapply(activities_amended$steps,activities_amended$count,mean)
```
a) Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps-

```{r}
max_value<-max(avg_steps_intervalwise)###
avg_steps_VS_time<-aggregate(activities$steps ~ activities$interval,FUN = mean)
colnames(avg_steps_VS_time)<-c("interval","steps")
```
b) Time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(interval,steps,data = avg_steps_VS_time,geom = "line")###
```
Imputing missing data with mean-

Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset

```{r}
library(Hmisc)
na_count<-nrow(activities[is.na(activities),])
```
data set with missing values imputed with mean-

```{r}
copy_activities<-activities
copy_activities$steps<-impute(copy_activities$steps,mean)
```

Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day-

```{r}
copy_activities_day_wise<-aggregate(copy_activities$steps ~ copy_activities$date,FUN = sum)
colnames(copy_activities_day_wise)<-c("date","steps")
hist(copy_activities_day_wise$steps,col = "red",xlim = range(copy_activities_day_wise$steps),main = "Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after imputing with mean")
```
Mean and median total number of steps taken per day-

```{r}
avg_after_imputing<-mean(copy_activities_day_wise$steps)############
median_after_imputing<-median(copy_activities_day_wise$steps)
```
Inference on the new mean and medians after imputing the missing data with mean-

  It can be seen that the mean has not changed (as expected), and the median has increased by 1.18867 (a very smal value indeed)


Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends? Let us see!

```{r}
activities_days<-activities
activities_days$day<-weekdays(activities_days$date)
activities_days$day_catagory<-factor(activities_days$day,levels = c("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday"),labels = c(rep("weekday",5),rep("weekend",2)))######
activities_days$steps<-with(activities_days,impute(steps,mean))
activities_days$nbrs<-factor(activities_days$day_catagory,levels = c("weekday","weekend"),labels = 1:2)
activities_days_daywise<-aggregate(activities_days$steps ~ (activities_days$interval * activities_days$nbrs),FUN = mean)
colnames(activities_days_daywise)<-c("interval","nbrs","steps")
```

Panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis)

```{r}
qplot(interval,steps,data = activities_days_daywise,geom = "line",facets = nbrs ~ .,mtext = "plot of the 5-minute interval and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days")
```

Yeah, there is a perceivable difference between them.
